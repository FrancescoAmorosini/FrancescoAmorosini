## Hey, I’m Francesco 👋

I’m a Senior AWS AI Engineer with a passion for building intelligent, production-grade systems. I have a background in Computer Engineering from Università degli Studi di Firenze and completed my Master’s in Computer Science and Engineering at Politecnico di Milano.

I’m based in Milan 🇮🇹 and currently working at a consulting firm where I design, build, and lead AI/ML projects from pre-sales to production — across teams, clients, and even companies within the same holding. My role combines architecture, engineering, project management, and communication, with a strong focus on GenAI, MLOps, and cloud-native deployments (mostly on AWS).
